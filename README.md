# MinimumSpanningTree

**Algorithm**

John and his friends decided to play a game where as many as climber can simultaneously climb the tree. Each climber can take only k=3 holds. each climber can choose any node to start with and all moves must be towards the root. However no climber allow to touch same node or path touch by other climber. So, Lets find how many person can play this game on this minimum spanning tree.
